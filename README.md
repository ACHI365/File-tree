Implement the method public static File toFileRepresentation (Path path) in the class FileUtil. The method is intended to provide a tree representation of the directory structure which takes the file at the path path as its parameter. Use objects of classes RegularFile and Directory for this purpose. If the file at the path path is a regular file, a representation of this file should be returned. If it is a directory, a representation of the entire file tree from this directory should be returned; the directory with path path should be the root of the tree.
